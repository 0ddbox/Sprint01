Main question: What does medieval music sound like?

- Medieval music often featured a single melody line, with little harmony or percussion. It was often performed without accompaniment, but instruments like the lute were later added. 

  Characteristics
Monophonic: A single melody line, unaccompanied

Looser rhythm and tonal center: Less structured than modern music 

Latin language: Used in many chants, such as Gregorian chant 

Based on sacred texts: Many chants were based on the Bible 

Repeating sections: Similar to folk dances, with first-time and second-time endings 

Examples:
Plainchant: A somber religious chant that was popular in the early Medieval period 
Gregorian chant: A well-known example of monophonic chant 

What do we know?
While there are accounts of minstrels and folk music, little sheet music survives. Because of this, it's not entirely clear what medieval music sounded like. 
Most people were illiterate, so not much sheet music reall exists from back then.
